# Reading List

Here's a few interesting papers that I feel people interested in computational neuroscience and Deep Learning in biomed would be interested in.

* Dendritic Computation [[Webpage]](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.neuro.28.061604.135703?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed) [[pdf]](https://neurophysics.ucsd.edu/courses/physics_171/annurev.neuro.28.061604.135703.pdf)

* Deep Learning in Biology
