# GRE Preparation Guide

The GRE has 3 basic sections:

* Verbal Section
* Quantitative Section
* Writing

There will be 5 sections (2, 3), where one section is experimental and will not be graded. You don't know which one this is, so attempt them all just as well. The future sections also get harder based off your performance in the previous ones, so prepare for your last couple to be a bit tricky.

### Quant Section

The Quant section is more or less easy, just make sure to go through the [syllabus](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/quantitative_reasoning) for it, and practise a few questions from each syllabus head. As you go through the practise tests, you most probably won't score full for the first 5 or even 10 sections you take, but with practise and in a couple of weeks' time, you should be consistently scoring full.

### Verbal Section

The Verbal Section is the meat of what makes the GRE difficult for so many people, but it's really not that difficult to figure out. The <i>one</i> thing that's going to make sure you score well is <b>word lists</b>. By the last week before your test, you should have atleast 10-15 pages worth of GRE words that you've encountered in the practise tests, and through the various apps that you'll practise with. You don't need to remember the definitions by rote, but get a sense of what they mean (For example, <i> obdurate</i> means "stubborn or tough", and that's all you need to know).

The Verbal section requires practise, and an essential thing you need to do is continuously keep noting down words you didn't know the meanings to, and go over them every few days until you have a sense of the word's meaning, anough to eliminate options in MCQ questions and enough to traverse some of the thornier paragraph questions.

The paragraph questions are also a bit tricky at times, but the practise tests, especially Kaplan, have an explanation for the logic behind the answers to those questions, and you need to go through them until you start thinking the GRE way, which isn't necessarily the logical way you're used to parsing paragraph information. Practise will make you quite good at this within a week or so.

### Writing

The Writing section's often overlooked during prep, but it's definitely important. There's always rumors floating about that so-and-so college's PhD admissions seek a score of 5 and above, so it's worth investing some time into it. For Indian students, I'd say our CBSE English essay writing techniques are quite on par with what the GRE expects, and I had not prepared much for this section beforehand. I <i>would</i> suggest going through a list of topics and bouncing a few ideas off your friends, so that you're aware of the common ideas and points to put across for a majority of topics.

## Resources

#### Word Lists

* [Magoosh Flash Cards](https://gre.magoosh.com/flashcards/vocabulary/decks) - This site, and their companion app, were invaluable to me to remember words and practise thoroughly. Definitely attempt to go through all the modules, and manually make a list of words that you're repetitively getting wrong.
* [5000 GRE and TOEFL Words](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B49ZdpZV9rTHYUhfOUhjYUtzU3c/view?usp=sharing) - This PDF's a bit of an overkill, but if you're looking for that elusive 340 score, by all means go through this.

#### Practise Tests

* Official ETS Practise Tests - When you register for the GRE, you'll get two practise tests. I'd suggest taking one test at the start of your preparation, and one test a day or two before exam day. That way, you'll have a good benchmark of your improvement.
* [Kaplan Online Resources](https://www.kaptest.com/pages/booksonline) - Under the GRE section, register or buy the GRE PRemier 201x Test Series. You get 20 Practise sections for Quant and VErbal each, and these were the meat of my preparation. Make word lists of every new word you encounter, and within no time you'll be sailing through these. I felt they were quite on par with the difficulty of the actual test I took.
* [5 lb. Book of GRE Practise Problems](https://www.amazon.com/lb-Book-GRE-Practice-Problems/dp/1937707296) - You honestly don't need any other resource for practise problems after this one. Loads of problems of equivalent difficulty to the actual test.
* [Cracking the GRE, Princeton Review](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Practice-Graduate-School-Preparation/dp/0804126046/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1503045266&sr=1-2&keywords=cracking+the+new+gre) - I found Princeton Review's explanations for the paragraph comprehension questions quite good. Helps make an intuition for what exactly they're looking for from comprehension questions.

#### Apps

* Magoosh Flashcards ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magoosh.flashcards.gre&hl=en), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gre-vocabulary-flashcards-from-magoosh/id672962658?mt=8)) - I used this app almost daily to go through 20-30 flashcards. It's super convenient, and they repeat a lot of the words, so the meanings are drilled into your head after a point.
* Manhattan GRE Prep ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hltcorp.gre&hl=en)) - They have a free 24 hour trial, so I'd suggest downloading the app a couple of days before your test, and blitzing through as many questions as possible in a 24 hour period.

#### On Test Day

* <b>Take your passport</b> - Don't make the mistake I did and submit your passport for a visa a few days before. They <i>will not</i> let you take the test with a photocopy or any other ID proof.
* Relax. You've done the prep, and the actual test itself is kinda fun. You'll have time to recheck a few answers in the Quant Sections, so make sure you do that, that's how you ensure a full score. You may be racing against time in the Verbal section, so if you encounter comprehension questions that aren't making sense to you, <i>move on</i> and come back later. Finish everything else, and then tackle the comprehension ones. For the writing section, take a few notes, compose your thoughts for a couple of minutes before you start typing.
