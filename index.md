I'm a first year Biomedical Engineering Graduate Student at the Johns Hopkins University. Previously, I have a Bachelors in Engineering Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology.

My research interests include medical imaging, computational neuroscience, and increasingly, Machine and Deep Learning methods in medicine and biology. [This paper](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/28/142760) is a good beginning resource to understand the scope of Deep Learning in medicine and biology.
