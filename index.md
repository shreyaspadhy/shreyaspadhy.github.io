I'm a Biomedical Engineering Graduate Student at the Johns Hopkins University. I also have a Bachelors in Engineering Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.

My research interests include medical imaging, computational neuroscience, and quite recently, Machine and Deep Learning methods in medicine and biology. [This paper](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/28/142760) is a good beginning resource to understand the scope of Deep Learning in medicine and biology.
